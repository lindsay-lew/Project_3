# Project 3: Webscraping

## What my ebay-dl.py file does:
This project focuses on collecting and analyzing eBay marketplace data for specific keywords. Using a Python script (ebay-dl.py), I automated the process of scraping item listings from the first 10 pages of eBay search results for given search terms. The script extracts relevant details about each itemâ€”such as the name, price (in cents), item status (Brand New, Pre-owned, etc.), shipping cost, whether or not the item has free returns, and the number of items sold. It then compiles this information into a structured JSON file. My repository includes three of these files, each corresponding to one of the keywords I searched: "beach chair," "sunglasses," and "swimsuit." These files were generated by running the script with each keyword as input.


## How to run my ebay-dl.py file:
```
python3 Project3/ebay-dl.py 'beach chair'
python3 Project3/ebay-dl.py 'sunglasses'
python3 Project3/ebay-dl.py 'swimsuit'
```
